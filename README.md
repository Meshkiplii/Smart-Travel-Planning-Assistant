# Smart-Travel-Planning-Assistant


## Scenario
I chose scenario 7, Smart Travel Planning Assistant. Under this scenario, Helen and her partner, who are planning to make a trip to Europe, have a problem planning their local and foreign travel. The complexity of ensuring that the flights, accommodations, daily activities, local transport, and budgeting are done from different platforms is what challenges her planning. The opportunity arises when there is a need to consolidate all these activities under one travel assistant app. The app needs to offer real-time organisation, give reminders and provide intelligent recommendations to help enhance her travel experience.

This scenario is meaningful because it offers a real-world problem I would want to solve. While I have seen and used some travel apps, I am privileged to learn how these apps work from a programmer's point of view. This scenario resonates with me because it combines logistical problem-solving with the joy of discovery and helps users transform their overwhelming details into seamless adventures.

## Target Audience
The target audience for this application is:
- Couples planning multi-destination trips
- Professionals who need automation of itinerary management
- International travellers
- First-time travellers looking for guided planning

**Strengths**
- Its major strength is that it helps direct bookings between travellers and hosts.
- There are no middlemen involved, hence leading to better deals for travellers.
- The reverse booking model in this app is amazing. Instead of travellers searching extensively, the host sends offers directly based on the traveller's needs.
- It has a payment method that allows instalments.

**Weaknesses**
- It has limited itinerary planning features for travellers.
- This app majors in booking rather than planning for a trip.
- It's limited to international travellers. Only a few regions that the app operates in.
- The user interface is not that great.
- The app also takes time to load features.
- There is no offline option.

## How Will My App Be Different?
One of the features that will make my app outstanding is the AI guide assistant. I will implement predictive suggestions that will notify of the time between scheduled events, user preferences and expense splitting. Also, each user will have their budget and reminders in one place. The option for uploading documents and receipts will be available in my app. I will allow users to download their expense list so that they can have the freedom to share their expense list.
